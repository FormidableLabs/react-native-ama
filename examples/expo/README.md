# Getting Started

Before getting started, make sure you have installed _node_modules_ by running `yarn` from the root of the project, then come back here.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_, simply run

```bash
npx expo start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Start your app in the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device. Use the QR code in the Metro Bundler to open your project or by pressing `a` for Android emulator, `i` for iOS simulator.
