# Mobile Accessibility Guidelines

This section contains accessibility best practices for native mobile apps.

The guidelines are based on the w3c recommendations [Accessibility Guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and are intended for use
by anyone building an accessible app with React Native and are not limited to being used with AMA.

## Severities

While the AMA guidelines categorize issues based on varying levels of severity, it's crucial to address each one to ensure complete accessibility of the app. Overlooking even the less severe guidelines can lead to an app that's challenging to navigate and use, potentially alienating a portion of the user base. Every user deserves an inclusive and seamless experience; adhering to all accessibility guidelines is the key to achieving that.

### <span class="ama-critical">Critical</span>

These best practices are mandatory and must be enforced. Failing to implement them will result in an inaccessible mobile app.

### <span class="ama-serious">Serious</span>

While these issues don't entirely prevent users with assistive technology from accessing the content, they pose significant challenges.

### <span class="ama-warning">Warning</span>

These best practices are considered "nice to have." Adhering to them enhances the accessibility of your app.
