# Mobile Accessibility Guidelines

This section contains accessibility best practices for native mobile apps.

The guidelines are based on the  w3c recommendations [Accessibility Guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and are intended for use
by anyone building an accessible app with React Native and are not limited to being used with AMA.

:::info

The guidelines are still work in progress and are not yet complete. The more feedback we get, the better the guidelines will be.
