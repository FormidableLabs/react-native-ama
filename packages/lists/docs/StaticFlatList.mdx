import { TalkBackList } from '@site/src/components';

# StaticFlatList

StaticFlatList extends the React Native FlatList component [focused on accessibility].

## Usage

```jsx
import { StaticFlatList } from '@react-native-ama/lists';

<StaticFlatList
  data={items}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  keyExtractor={item => item.id}
/>
```

## Accessibility Improvements

- On `Android` allows TalkBack to announce **in list**/**out list** or **in grid**/**out of grid**

### TalkBack

<TalkBackList />

To provide this accessibility feature, AMA wraps the list in the custom native
component: [ListWrapper](./ListWrapper.mdx).


## Additional props

### `rowsCount`

The number of rows of the list/grid. If empty, the length of the data is used to calculate it and divided by `numColumns`.

:::note

When passing `rowsCount`, it is used as it is and is assumed that the number of columns has been taken into account.

:::

### `numColumns`

The number of columns of the list/grid.
