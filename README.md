[![github][github-image]][github-url] [![npm][npm-image]][npm-url] [![docs][docs-image]][docs-url] [![Maintenance Status][maintenance-image]](#maintenance-status)

A.M.A. stands for **A**ccessible **M**obile **A**pp and is react native library that aim offers the best accessibility tooling experience and guides to guide you through accessibility best practices while you code your app.
That's why we created A.M.A., a set of [components](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/react-native-ama/components/),
[hooks](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/react-native-ama/components/) designed to enforce minimum accessibility requirements.
This is combined with extensive [guidelines](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/react-native-ama/guidelines/) to help you how accessibility should work when manually testing your app.
