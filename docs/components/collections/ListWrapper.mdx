# ListWrapper

ListWrapper is a custom native component for Android that allows TalkBack to recognise that its children are part of a list/grid and behave accordingly.

<TalkBackList />

This component can be used to wrap custom a FlatList whenever they do not provide the same accessibility experienced with native Android apps. [^1]

## Usage

```jsx
import  {ListWrapper } from "react-native-ama";


<ListWrapper rowsCount={10} columnsCount={1}>
    <MyCustomFlatList />
</ListWrapper>
```

:::note

On iOS, the component is rendered as Fragment as this behaviour is native to Android only.

## Props

### `rowsCount`

The number of rows to be announced by TalkBack.

### `columnsCount`

This optional parameter is used by TalkBack to know if the user landed on a List or a Grid.
The default value of **1** makes TalkBack read: **in list** / **out of list**, while a bigger number: in grid / out of grid

[^1]: The component is internally used by [FlatList](/docs/components/FlatList), [DynamicFlatList](/docs/components/FlatList/DynamicFlatList) and [StaticFlatList](/docs/components/FlatList/StaticFlatList)
