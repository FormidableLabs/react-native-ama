# AutofocusContainer

It is a utility component that automatically calls the [useFocus](../hooks/useFocus) hook when it is mounted.

## Usage

```jsx
import {AutofocusContainer} from "react-native-ama";

<AutofocusContainer props={}>{children}</AutofocusContainer>
```

## Example

This component can be used to move the focus on dynamically shown components, for example:

```jsx title="UseTimedAction.screen.tsx"
    <View style={styles.centeredView}>
    <CTAPressable title="Show timed content" onPress={handleOnPress}/>
    {showContent ? (
        <AutofocusContainer>
            <Text>Great! You did it :)</Text>
            <Spacer height="big"/>
            <CTAPressable title="Show home screen"/>
        </AutofocusContainer>
    ) : null}
</View>
```

In this example, we want to move the focus to the view rendered once the user taps on "Show timed content".

:::warning

The autofocus works only if the container contains accessible elements, like Text, Buttons, etc.
Alternatively, bypassing the [accessibilityLabel](#accessibility-label) property, the child will be wrapped in an accessible View.
:::

## Accessibility

- Once the focus is moved makes, the screen reader announces all the text present in that container

## Props

### accessibilityLabel

The label to assign to the wrapping View container.
