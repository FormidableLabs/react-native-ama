# Intro

AMA stands for **A**ccessible **M**obile **A**pp and contains a set of accessible components and hooks to simplify the building of accessible apps.

## Installation

Install _react-native-ama_ using either `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev react-native-ama
```

### Configuration

Create an empty json file called `ama.json`, if does not exists, in the root of your project. This is used to be able to specify [custom rules](/docs/guidelines/).

```json title="ama.json"
{
}
```
