# Lists

## Number of results

If a list is filtered as a result of any UI interaction the screen reader **must** announce the number of elements the list is showing.

For example, if a search box updates the list a list while the user is typing, the screen reader **must** read how many items we are displaying after applying the filter, if the number is different from the total list of items. Same if a list is filtered because we used a filter via a button.

If we fail to do so we force the user to scroll all the time to the list and back to know what's going on
