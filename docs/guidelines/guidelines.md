# Mobile Accessibility Guidelines

This section contains accessibility best practices for native mobile apps.

The guidelines are based on the w3c recommendations [Accessibility Guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and are intended for use
by anyone building an accessible app with React Native and are not limited to being used with AMA.

## Severities

The AMA guidelines are labelled with different levels of severity to indicate their importance.

### <span class="ama-critical">Critical</span>

These best practices are mandatory and must be enforced. Failing to implement them will result in an inaccessible mobile app.

### <span class="ama-serious">Serious</span>

While these issues don't entirely prevent users with assistive technology from accessing the content, they pose significant challenges.

### <span class="ama-warning">Warning</span>

These best practices are considered "nice to have." Adhering to them enhances the accessibility of your app.
